    <h3>Rule : - To use DOm function in website</h3>
    <p>1. Alwyas remember the mouse cursor is working at X-axis and Y-axis but you can rename as per you suitability,but
        remember to use X and Y as parameters <br>
        2. You can not use mouse effects on body directly, so you have to take a transparent bodysize div and write
        something like "
    <div>" so mouse effect work on div directly. <br>
        3. If you wannna create the mouse effects directly to body, you have to use query selector.....</p>
